The uva-seas-thesis package provides formatting and stylistic commands that
ensure documents adhere to the guidelines of the University of Virginia's
School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) and Print Services. This LaTeX
package is designed to be easier to use than other packages that mix content
and presentation; specifically, this package is interoperable with a variety of
LaTeX classes (e.g., book) that control most of the actual formatting
decisions.

.. attention::
   Development has moved to the latex-virginia.edu_ repository, and this
   repository has been archived!
